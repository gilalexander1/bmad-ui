└── agent_orchestrator.py    # Agent coordination
```

### Integration Layer
- **Ecosystem Root:** `../../..` (gil-dev-ecosystem)
- **Config Source:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- **Agents Path:** `agents/` (ecosystem agents)  
- **Templates Path:** `infrastructure/templates/`

## User Experience Design

### 🌌 Cosmic Theme Specifications
- **Color Palette:** 
  - Primary: #00ff41 (Matrix Green)
  - Secondary: #0066ff (Cosmic Blue)
  - Accent: #ff0066 (Alert Red)
  - Background: Space gradients with animated stars
- **Typography:**
  - Headers: Orbitron (futuristic)
  - Body: System fonts
  - Terminal: JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- **Effects:**
  - Glass morphism cards with backdrop blur
  - Blinking buttons and status indicators
  - Glow effects on interactive elements
  - Smooth animations with Framer Motion

### 🎮 Interaction Patterns
- **Hover Effects** - Scale transformations and glow increases
- **Loading States** - Animated progress bars with particle effects
- **Status Indicators** - Pulsing lights and blinking text
- **Terminal Output** - Typewriter effects with cursor blinking

## Integration Requirements

### Ecosystem Agents Integration
1. **project_creator** - Creates new projects from templates
2. **feature_builder** - Builds features from user stories  
3. **integration_helper** - Handles infrastructure setup
4. **debugging_assistant** - Provides QA and debugging support

### Workflow Coordination
